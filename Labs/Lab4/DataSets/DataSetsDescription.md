Data sets description:

BD Oua UV 2022: <br />

> Using a spectrofotometer the light travelling through the egg shell was measured, thus obtaining the percentage of ligth that passes through the shell for each wavelength from 30 to 700 nm. The spectrum was split in three types of wavelngths: UV, MW and LW; <br />
> It is of interest to find out if there exist correlations between the amount of light that passes through the shell and the egg's properties: membrane, colour, habitat, incubation period and the type of species. For each species there have been done five measurments.

BD Gall Rall Cot Egg submersion: <br />

> An experiment has been done on three species of birds: Rallus aquaticus, Coturnix coturnix and Gallinula galeata. Their eggs have been split into three groups: normal hatching, submersed for two hours and for three hours. The submersion was done before incubation; <br />
> It is of interest to find the difference between species and the resistances to the embryos being inundated.
